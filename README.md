# Garden Genie Backend

For the final full stack project at the School of Code, my team had the opportunity to address a real-world problem and plan, design and develop a full-stack web app within five weeks.

### The challenge:
Simplify gardening for individuals, addressing the common barriers that often deter people from starting their gardening journey.

### Our solution:
An app that delivers personalised plant recommendations based on user preferences. On the frontend, we harnessed the power of React for its code reusability, state management, and seamless deployment, to create a high-functionint frontend. For the backend, we efficiently managed plant data using Node, Express, and MongoDB in a non-relational database.

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```bash
$ npm -v && node -v
```


    
## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone (https://github.com/AnastasiaAdamoudi/GardenGenieBackend)
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
  npm start
```

The server will start on your local machine and will connect to the MondoDB database that contains the plant data.


## API endpoints

On your local machine, the endpoints are the following:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```
```
http://localhost:5000/form
```
```
http://localhost:5000/results
```
```
http://localhost:5000/plant-info
```


## Server

To run the app locally along with its original client, follow the instructions on the relevant repo to also start the client: [GardenGenieFrontend](https://github.com/AnastasiaAdamoudi/M.A.S.H.E.D_Garden_Genie).
